## Technical Overview:

On server side I used Express.js, cors for sending and getting data through different ports, routes and controllers for
all API actions.

On client side I used Redux for using global state, including redux thunk for async request to the API. API calls using
axios.js. Material UI has been used also. Highlight component using Regex to match searched values to td innerText
words, this component function has been written with vanilla JavaScript.
